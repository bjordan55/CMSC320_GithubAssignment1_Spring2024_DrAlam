Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?
A: I want to take this class as an elective and also a prerequisite for a minor I might apply to called computational finance. 
So at least this will count as an elective and if I find out I like it I can take more classes but ideally I am taknig it because
it is one of the classes I need should I get accepted into the minor.
